The next two sprays should be done at intervals of 10 days. After 25 to 30 days of sowing, ie after seedling height of 12-15 cm, seedlings should be restored to the entire world.

After dipping the tubing for 15 minutes, the potato is removed from the solution and spread on a tropical or salty berry in a shady place so that the humidity of the tubers is reduced. Once the solution becomes too dirty or too little, then the new solution is prepared by throwing that solution and adding water to it again. Emission-6 is cheaper to prepare solutions for fungicide. In the absence of this, indofil M-45, capaffe or blitax can be dissolved in 2.5 gm per liter of water. This means that chemical seed treatment is essential.
